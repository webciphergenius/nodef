# Shipment Fields Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ Already Implemented

### 1. Location Name Fields

- **`pickup_location_name`** - ‚úÖ Already implemented (optional)
- **`pickup_name`** - ‚úÖ New field added (optional)
- **`dropoff_location_name`** - ‚úÖ Already implemented (optional)
- **`dropoff_name`** - ‚úÖ New field added (optional)

**Implementation Details:**

- ‚úÖ Fields are extracted from request body in `createShipment` function
- ‚úÖ Fields are included in database INSERT statement
- ‚úÖ Fields are returned in API responses (e.g., `listAcceptedShipments`)
- ‚úÖ Fields are documented in API_DOCUMENTATION.md
- ‚úÖ Fields are marked as optional in API documentation

### 2. Multiple Image Upload

- **`shipment_images`** - ‚úÖ Already implemented for multiple uploads

**Implementation Details:**

- ‚úÖ Route configured with `upload.array("shipment_images")` for multiple files
- ‚úÖ Controller handles multiple files in loop: `for (const file of req.files)`
- ‚úÖ Images are uploaded to Cloudflare R2 or local storage
- ‚úÖ URLs are stored as JSON array in database
- ‚úÖ API documentation shows `File[]` type for multiple uploads

## üîß Database Migration Needed

The location name fields need to be added to the database schema:

```sql
ALTER TABLE shipments ADD COLUMN pickup_location_name VARCHAR(255) NULL AFTER pickup_zip;
ALTER TABLE shipments ADD COLUMN dropoff_location_name VARCHAR(255) NULL AFTER dropoff_zip;
```

**Migration Script:** `add-location-name-fields.js` (created but needs to be run in production)

## üìã Current API Usage

### Create Shipment Request

```javascript
POST /api/shipment/create

// Form fields:
vehicle_type: "Van"

pickup_name: "John's Warehouse"                    // ‚úÖ NEW OPTIONAL FIELD
pickup_lat: "40.7128"
pickup_lng: "-74.0060"
dropoff_zip: "67890"
dropoff_location_name: "456 Oak Ave, City, State"  // ‚úÖ OPTIONAL FIELD
dropoff_name: "Mary's Store"                       // ‚úÖ NEW OPTIONAL FIELD
dropoff_lat: "40.7589"
dropoff_lng: "-73.9851"
service_level: "Standard"
declared_value: 100.00
terms_acknowledged: true
package_instructions: "Handle with care"
recipient_mobile: "+1234567890"
shipment_images: [file1.jpg, file2.jpg, file3.jpg]  // ‚úÖ MULTIPLE FILES
```

### Response

```json
{
  "msg": "Shipment created. Complete payment to proceed.",
  "shipment_identifier": "shipment-20240101-00001",
  "payment_url": "https://checkout.stripe.com/...",
  "recipient_mobile": "+1234567890",
  "qr_token": "abc123..."
}
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Run Database Migration** (in production):

   ```bash
   node add-location-name-fields.js
   ```

2. **Test the Implementation**:

   - Create a shipment with location names
   - Upload multiple images
   - Verify data is stored correctly

3. **Update Frontend** (if needed):
   - Add input fields for location names
   - Configure multiple file upload UI
   - Display location names in shipment details

## üìù Code Locations

- **Controller**: `controllers/shipmentController.js` (lines 33, 37, 108, 112, 128, 132)
- **Routes**: `routes/shipmentRoutes.js` (line 14)
- **API Docs**: `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` (lines 185, 189, 196)
- **Migration**: `add-location-name-fields.js`

## ‚úÖ Summary

**Both requested features are already fully implemented in the code:**

1. ‚úÖ **Location Name Fields**: `pickup_location_name` and `dropoff_location_name` are fully integrated (optional fields)
2. ‚úÖ **Multiple Image Upload**: `shipment_images` supports multiple file uploads

**Only remaining task**: Run the database migration script in production to add the new columns to the shipments table.
